# **Discretionary Access Control (DAC) – In-Depth Explanation**  

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** is an authorization model where **resource owners have full control over permissions** and can grant or revoke access at their discretion. Unlike RBAC and ABAC, which enforce access policies centrally, DAC allows **individual users** to set access rights to resources they own.

---

# **1. What is DAC?**  
DAC is an **access control model** where the **owner of a resource decides** who can access it and what operations they can perform. The system enforces access based on **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** or **Capability Lists (C-Lists).**

## **Key Characteristics of DAC**
1. **User-Managed Access** → The resource owner decides access levels.  
2. **Identity-Based Control** → Access rights are assigned to **specific users or groups**.  
3. **Flexible but Less Secure** → Users can unintentionally grant access, leading to security risks.  
4. **Common in OS & File Systems** → Used in Linux, Windows NTFS, and database systems.

---

# **2. How DAC Works - Conceptual Flow**
1. **A user (resource owner) assigns permissions** to other users.  
2. **The operating system (or application) stores these permissions** in an Access Control List (ACL).  
3. **When a request is made, the system checks** the ACL to determine access.  

---

# **3. Example: DAC in Action**
## **Scenario: A File System with DAC**
A company has a **file system** where employees create documents. The document creator can **share it with specific users**.

| **File**      | **Owner** | **Permissions** (ACL) |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| report.docx | Alice   | Bob (read), Charlie (write) |
| design.pdf  | Bob     | Alice (read, write), David (read) |

## **How Permissions Work:**
1. **Alice creates report.docx** → She is the **owner**.  
2. **Alice grants Bob read access** → Bob can view but not edit.  
3. **Alice grants Charlie write access** → Charlie can edit the file.  

## **Access Evaluation:**
✅ **Bob tries to read "report.docx"** → **Access Granted**  
❌ **Bob tries to write "report.docx"** → **Access Denied**  
✅ **Charlie tries to edit "report.docx"** → **Access Granted**

# **4. DAC Components**
## **1. Access Control List (ACL)**
- **Each resource (file, database, etc.) has an ACL.**  
- **ACL defines which users (or groups) can access the resource and their permissions.**  

### **Example ACL Entry:**
```plaintext
report.docx:
  Alice: owner
  Bob: read
  Charlie: write
```

## **2. Capability List (C-List)**
- **Each user has a list of resources they can access.**  
- Unlike ACLs (which are resource-based), C-Lists are **user-based**.

### **Example Capability List:**
| **User**   | **Files They Can Access** |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Bob**    | report.docx (read), design.pdf (read) |
| **Charlie** | report.docx (write) |

**ACL vs. C-List:**
| Feature | Access Control List (ACL) | Capability List (C-List) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Stored With** | The resource | The user |
| **Best For** | Managing permissions at a **resource level** | Managing permissions at a **user level** |
| **Example** | "Bob can read report.docx" | "Bob has read access to report.docx" |

# **5. DAC in Operating Systems**
DAC is **widely used in OS-level security**, such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## **Linux File Permissions (DAC Example)**
In Linux, each file has **three permission levels:**
- **Owner** (User who created the file).
- **Group** (Users in the same group).
- **Others** (All other users).

## **Example:**
```bash
ls -l report.docx
-rw-r--r--  1 alice  staff  1024 Mar 23 10:00 report.docx
```
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `-rw-r--r--` | Owner (read, write), Group (read), Others (read) |
| `1 alice staff` | Owner is `Alice`, Group is `staff` |
| `1024` | File size in bytes |
| `Mar 23 10:00` | Last modified date |

### **Modifying Permissions with chmod**
Alice can grant write access to Bob using:
```bash
chmod o+w report.docx
```

# **6. DAC in Databases**
DAC is **commonly used in relational databases (RDBMS)** such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

## **Example: MySQL DAC Implementation**
- The **database owner** (admin) grants specific access to users.
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO 'bob'@'localhost';
REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM 'bob'@'localhost';
```
- **Bob can now read but not insert data** into the `employees` table.

# **7. Advantages of DAC**
| **Advantage** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Simple & Easy to Implement** | Users manage their own permissions. |
| **Fine-Grained Access** | Users can control access at an individual file level. |
| **Flexibility** | Users can modify permissions dynamically. |
| **Widely Supported** | Built into OS (Linux, Windows), Databases, and Cloud Platforms. |

---

# **8. Disadvantages & Security Risks of DAC**
| **Challenge** | **Risk** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Privilege Escalation** | Users can grant access to others, leading to security risks. |
| **No Centralized Control** | Administrators do not have full control over access policies. |
| **Difficult to Manage at Scale** | In large organizations, managing individual permissions becomes complex. |
| **Malware Risks** | Users with excessive permissions can execute malicious programs. |

## **Example: Privilege Escalation Attack**
If Bob has **write access** to a script file, he can modify it to execute malicious commands when another user runs it.

# **9. DAC vs. Other Access Control Models**
| Feature | DAC (Discretionary) | RBAC (Role-Based) | ABAC (Attribute-Based) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Control** | Owner-based | Role-based | Attribute-based |
| **Flexibility** | High | Moderate | Very High |
| **Security Risk** | High (users can share access) | Medium | Low |
| **Scalability** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Example Use Case** | Personal file sharing | Enterprise access control | Cloud security policies |

---

# **10. DAC Use Cases**
| **Industry** | **Use Case** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Personal Computers** | Users set file/folder permissions manually. |
| **Software Development** | Developers control repository access (GitHub). |
| **Databases** | Admins grant specific table permissions to users. |
| **Cloud Storage** | Google Drive allows users to share documents with specific people. |

---

# **11. Key Takeaways**
- **DAC allows resource owners to control access** to their files and data.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** store permissions for each resource.
- **Capability Lists (C-Lists)** store permissions for each user.
- **Used in operating systems (Linux, Windows), databases, and cloud storage.**
- **More flexible but less secure** than RBAC and ABAC.
- **Prone to privilege escalation** and **security misconfigurations**.
