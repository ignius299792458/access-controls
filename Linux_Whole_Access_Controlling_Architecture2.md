### **High-Level Overview of Integrated Access Control Mechanisms**:
- **Kernel**: Handles the low-level access control mechanisms, including Mandatory Access Control (MAC) via SELinux or AppArmor, and **fine-grained control** via **capabilities**.
- **User Space**: Userland processes interact with the kernel and use **RBAC**, **DAC**, **ACLs**, and **app-specific policies** to access resources. This also includes tools like **Systemd** for service management and **PAM** for authentication.
- **File System**: File access control in Linux is done with **traditional UNIX permissions (DAC)**, **ACLs**, and can be hardened with **SELinux** or **AppArmor**. **Encrypted file systems** like **LUKS** enhance data confidentiality.
- **Networking**: Network security is primarily managed by **iptables**, **nftables**, **SELinux**, and **AppArmor** policies. Tools like **TCP Wrappers** are used to control service access, and **network namespaces** help with process isolation.
- **Boot Process**: The boot process is secured with **UEFI Secure Boot** and **kernel module signing** to protect against malicious code before the OS is fully loaded. **GRUB** and **systemd** ensure a secure boot and initialization.
- **Process & Service Management**: Process security is achieved with **namespaces** for isolation (e.g., process and network), **cgroups** for resource management, and **AppArmor/SELinux** for policy enforcement. Services (daemons) like **SSH** or **HTTPD** are further protected by **RBAC** and **AppArmor/SELinux**.
- **Device Security**: Linux uses **udev rules** to control access to hardware devices and **device ACLs** to manage device-level permissions. Kernel modules can be signed to prevent loading malicious modules.

### **Key Points**:
- **Access Control Mechanisms**: A combination of **DAC**, **MAC**, **RBAC**, **capabilities**, and **cgroups** protects Linux resources at different layers.
- **Granular Security**: Policies can be tailored at **file**, **process**, **network**, **service**, and **user** levels.
- **Security Frameworks**: Tools like **SELinux**, **AppArmor**, **PAM**, **auditd**, and **firewalld** strengthen Linux’s defense against unauthorized access.
