# Monolithic and microservice architectures with strategic reasons for using them:

## **1. Authentication**
- **Monolithic**: Use **centralized authentication (OAuth/OpenID Connect)** for single sign-on to improve user experience and reduce login fatigue.
- **Microservices**: Use **OAuth/OpenID Connect** with **API Gateway** to centralize authentication, improving scalability and maintaining security across services.

## **2. Authorization**
- **Monolithic**: Implement **RBAC/ABAC** for roles and permissions to control resource access, ensuring secure user-specific actions.
- **Microservices**: Use **RBAC/ABAC** within each service for decentralized control, allowing each service to independently enforce security policies.

## **3. Least Privilege**
- **Monolithic**: Ensure **minimal permissions** based on roles to limit access to only necessary resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.
- **Microservices**: Enforce **service-to-service permissions** to ensure microservices only have access to the data they need, reducing the attack surface.

## **4. Token & Session Management**
- **Monolithic**: Use **JWT tokens** with **secure cookies** for session management to enhance security, scalability, and ease of token refresh.
- **Microservices**: Implement **stateless JWT authentication** and **token-based service communication** to maintain scalability and avoid centralized session stores.

## **5. Granular Access Control & Auditing**
- **Monolithic**: Implement **granular access control** at the API and UI layers for specific resources, ensuring detailed user-level permissions.
- **Microservices**: Use **centralized logging and monitoring** to track access patterns and enforce access control policies across services.

## **6. Secure Service Communication**
- **Monolithic**: Ensure **internal API security** with access control for sensitive components, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to internal resources.
- **Microservices**: Use **mTLS** and **service mesh** for secure inter-service communication, ensuring encrypted, trusted service-to-service interactions.

## **7. Data Encryption**
- **Monolithic**: Encrypt sensitive data **at rest and in transit** to protect user privacy and ensure secure data storage.
- **Microservices**: Enforce **end-to-end encryption** for inter-service communication to ensure that sensitive data remains secure across distributed services.

## **8. Identity Federation & SSO**
- **Monolithic**: Use **SSO** for centralized identity management, improving user experience and reducing the need for multiple logins.
- **Microservices**: Implement **federated identity** for seamless access across multiple services, ensuring consistent authentication across distributed systems. 

Each of these strategies is designed to improve **security**, **scalability**, and **user experience**, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access the right resources while reducing the risk of unauthorized access and system breaches.
